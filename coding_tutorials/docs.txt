## Folders' structure

I'll explain the structure breifly and it applies to all other folders.

for Generative_Archetictures folder it is structured like this:
	
	->Distillation_VQ
	->Generative_Archetictures-
				|				
				->Autoregressive
				->Diffusion
				->Flow_matching
				...
				->GANs	-
					|
					->GANs.ipynb
					->comprehensiveGANs_files-
								 |
								 ->cGAN
								 ->InfoGANs
								 ...

so in a nutshell every topic you explain make a folder for it if there isn't, and inside that folder put the .ipynb and make a folder for the images.
if you gonna explain multiple archetictures inside one .ipynb like the GANs tutorial (which explained 7 archetictures) then it is advisable to organize 
each archeticture inside its own folder inside the 'images folder'.

## Rules to follow:

->you need to train a model or if the tutorial is finetuning then you need to do so to make sure your implemenation works! (exception if you want to 
explain a mechanism without touching the archeticture e.g. attention, affine coupling, etc...)

->you need to upload the saved model to the shared google drive, don't push it to github.

->kindly work on a branch. (don't push to main directly and thank you)
